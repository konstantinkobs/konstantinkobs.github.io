[{"title": "On Background Bias in Deep Metric Learning", "authors": ["Konstantin Kobs", "A. Hotho"], "abstract": "Deep Metric Learning trains a neural network to map input images to a lower-dimensional embedding space such that similar images are closer together than dissimilar images. When used for item retrieval, a query image is embedded using the trained model and the closest items from a database storing their respective embeddings are returned as the most similar items for the query. Especially in product retrieval, where a user searches for a certain product by taking a photo of it, the image background is usually not important and thus should not in\ufb02uence the embedding process. Ideally, the retrieval process always returns \ufb01tting items for the photographed object, regardless of the environment the photo was taken in. In this paper, we analyze the in\ufb02uence of the image background on Deep Metric Learning models by utilizing \ufb01ve common loss functions and three common datasets. We \ufb01nd that Deep Metric Learning networks are prone to so-called background bias, which can lead to a severe decrease in retrieval performance when changing the image background during inference. We also show that replacing the background of images during training with random background images alleviates this issue. Since we use an automatic background removal method to do this background replacement, no additional manual labeling work and model changes are required while inference time stays the same. Qualitative and quantitative analyses, for which we introduce a new evaluation metric, con\ufb01rm that models trained with replaced backgrounds attend more to the main object in the image, bene\ufb01tting item retrieval systems.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "publicationDate": "2022-10-04", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dda1062bc212583ad6a5e9e09de109fd0c86d0ea"}, {"title": "WueDevils at SemEval-2022 Task 8: Multilingual News Article Similarity via Pair-Wise Sentence Similarity Matrices", "authors": ["Dirk Wangsadirdja", "Felix Heinickel", "Simon Trapp", "Albin Zehe", "Konstantin Kobs", "A.

Recommending collaborations automatically can alleviate the time consuming and tedious search for potential collaborators. Usually, such recommendation systems rely on graph structures modeling co-authorship of papers and content-based relations such as similar paper keywords. Models are then trained to estimate the probability of links between certain authors in these graphs.In this paper, we argue that the order of papers is crucial for reliably predicting future collaborations, which is not considered by graph-based recommendation systems. We thus propose to reformulate the task of collaboration recommendation as a sequential recommendation task. Here, we aim to predict the next co-author in a chronologically sorted sequence of an author\u2019s collaborators. We introduce CoBERT, a BERT4Rec inspired model, that predicts the sequence\u2019s next co-author and thus a potential collaborator. Since the order of co-authors of a single paper is not that important compared to the overall paper order, we leverage positional embeddings encoding paper positions instead of co-author positions in the sequence. Additionally, we inject content features about every paper and their co-authors. We evaluate CoBERT on two datasets consisting of papers from the field of Artificial Intelligence and the journal PlosOne. We show that CoBERT can outperform graph-based methods and BERT4Rec when predicting the co-authors of the next paper.

One potential reason for this unexpected result is that all losses let the network focus on similar image regions or properties. In this paper, we investigate this by conducting a two-step analysis to extract and compare the learned visual features of the same model architecture trained with different loss functions: First, we compare the learned features on the pixel level by correlating saliency maps of the same input images. Second, we compare the clustering of embeddings for several image properties, e.g. object color or illumination. To provide independent control over these properties, photo-realistic 3D car renders similar to images in the Cars196 dataset are generated. In our analysis, we compare 14 pretrained models from a recent study and find that, even though all models perform similarly, different loss functions can guide the model to learn different features. We especially find differences between classification and ranking based losses. Our analysis also shows that some seemingly irrelevant properties can have significant influence on the resulting embedding.

We argue that the ImageNet classification task is not well-suited for pretraining, since content based classification is designed to make the model invariant to features that strongly influence the image\u2019s aesthetics, e.g. stylebased features such as brightness or contrast.We propose to use self-supervised aesthetic-aware pretext tasks that let the network learn aesthetically relevant features, based on the observation that distorting aesthetic images with image filters usually reduces their appeal. To ensure that images are not accidentally improved when filters are applied, we introduce a large dataset comprised of highly aesthetic images as the starting point for the distortions. The network is then trained to rank less distorted images higher than their more distorted counterparts. To exploit effects of multiple different objectives, we also embed this task into a multi-task setting by adding either a self-supervised classification or regression task. In our experiments, we show that our pretraining improves performance over the ImageNet initialization and reduces the number of epochs until convergence by up to 47%.

Hotho"], "abstract": "In recent years, streaming platforms for video games have seen increasingly large interest, as so-called esports have developed into a lucrative branch of business. Like for other sports, watching esports has become a new kind of entertainment medium, which is possible due to platforms that allow gamers to live stream their gameplay, the most popular platform being Twitch.tv. On these platforms, users can comment on streams in real time and thereby express their opinion about the events in the stream. Due to the popularity of Twitch.tv, this can be a valuable source of feedback for streamers aiming to improve their reception in a gaming-oriented audience. In this work, we explore the possibility of deriving feedback for video streams on Twitch.tv by analyzing the sentiment of live text comments made by stream viewers in highly active channels. Automatic sentiment analysis on these comments is a challenging task, as one can compare the language used in Twitch.tv with that used by an audience in a stadium, shouting as loud as possible in sometimes nonorganized ways. This language is very different from common English, mixing Internet slang and gaming-related language with abbreviations, intentional and unintentional grammatical and orthographic mistakes, and emoji-like images called emotes. Classic lexicon-based sentiment analysis techniques therefore fail when applied to Twitch comments. To overcome the challenge posed by the nonstandard language, we propose two unsupervised lexicon-based approaches that make heavy use of the information encoded in emotes, as well as a weakly supervised neural network\u2013based classifier trained on the lexicon-based outputs, which is supposed to help generalization to unknown words by use of domain-specific word embeddings. To enable better understanding of Twitch.tv comments, we analyze a large dataset of comments, uncovering specific properties of their language, and provide a smaller set of comments labeled with sentiment information by crowdsourcing. We present two case studies showing the effectiveness of our methods in generating sentiment trajectories for events live streamed on Twitch.tv that correlate well with specific topics in the given stream. This allows for a new kind of implicit real-time feedback gathering for Twitch streamers and companies producing games or streaming content on Twitch.

Hotho"], "abstract": "Fully- or semi-automatic image enhancement software helps users to increase the visual appeal of photos and does not require in-depth knowledge of manual image editing. However, fully-automatic approaches usually enhance the image in a black-box manner that does not give the user any control over the optimization process, possibly leading to edited images that do not subjectively appeal to the user. Semi-automatic methods mostly allow for controlling which pre-defined editing step is taken, which restricts the users in their creativity and ability to make detailed adjustments, such as brightness or contrast. We argue that incorporating user preferences by guiding an automated enhancement method simplifies image editing and increases the enhancement's focus on the user. This work thus proposes the Neural Image Correction & Enhancement Routine (NICER), a neural network based approach to no-reference image enhancement in a fully-, semi-automatic or fully manual process that is interactive and user-centered. NICER iteratively adjusts image editing parameters in order to maximize an aesthetic score based on image style and content. Users can modify these parameters at any time and guide the optimization process towards a desired direction. This interactive workflow is a novelty in the field of human-computer interaction for image enhancement tasks. In a user study, we show that NICER can improve image aesthetics without user interaction and that allowing user interaction leads to diverse enhancement outcomes that are strongly preferred over the unedited image.

For computers, however, emotion recognition is a complex problem: Thoughts and feelings are the roots of many behavioural responses and they are deeply entangled with neurophysiological changes within humans. As such, emotions are very subjective, often are expressed in a subtle manner, and are highly depending on context. For example, machine learning approaches for text-based sentiment analysis often rely on incorporating sentiment lexicons or language models to capture the contextual meaning. This paper explores if and how we further can enhance sentiment analysis using biofeedback of humans which are experiencing emotions while reading texts. Specifically, we record the heart rate and brain waves of readers that are presented with short texts which have been annotated with the emotions they induce. We use these physiological signals to improve the performance of a lexicon-based sentiment classifier.
